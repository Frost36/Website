        <h2>Senior Thesis Research</h2>
        <p>
            In my senior year I worked on a methodology for verifying the
            correctness of a compiler phase, in this case specifically closure
            conversion. To do this I created a shared language that combines
            the source and target languages together, allowing source and target
            programs to be meaningfully compared to one another. To do this
            comparison I used contextual equivalence, which effectively says
            that two programs are equivalent if no matter how they are used
            they cannot be differentiated. Thus I proved that the compiler
            compiles the source program to an equivalent target program, so
            that the two behave the same, which verifies correctness. You can
            view my poster on my thesis <a href="projects/thesis_poster.pdf">here</a>,
            as well as my full thesis <a href="projects/thesis.pdf">here</a>.

        <h2>Independent Study Research</h2>
        <p>
            In my junior year I did an independent study where I implemented a 
            static verification checker for the language 
            <a href="http://c0.typesafety.net/">C0</a>. I used the 
            <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/">Z3</a> theorem prover to actually 
            perform the analysis of checking certain conditions given certain 
            facts. The tool I created checks for many errors, including array 
            index-out-of-bounds accesses, null pointer dereferences, arithmetic 
            errors (like division by zero). It does this by making use of the 
            languages contracts, which are statements that make guarantees 
            about variables while inside loops and when entering or leaving a 
            function. You can view my poster on my work
            <a href="projects/indep_poster.pdf">here</a>.

        <h2>C0 Compiler</h2>
        <p>
            In my Compiler Design course (15-411), I wrote a full compiler for
			the language <a href="http://c0.typesafety.net/">C0</a> with a 
			partner. The compiler takes C0 programs and compiles them into 
			x86-64 assembly, which is linked to a runtime system. The runtime 
			also has a mark-and-copy garbage collector that is integrated into 
			the code if used. It also has an implementation of our semantics 
			for having <b>free</b> in C0 (while still being defined in all 
			cases). I primarily worked on the parser, elaboration, typechecking, 
			and translation (as well as parts of the garbage collector). We 
			plan to continue development on it in our spare time.

            For my Introduction to Computer Systems course (15-123), I wrote a 
            basic internet proxy in C with a partner. I focused mainly on 
            interpreting information recieved from the client/server, as well 
            as caching data for faster retrieval. Code available upon request.

            Also for my Introduction to Computer Systems course (15-123), I 
            wrote a dynamic memory allocator in C. I implemented it as a 
            segregated free list for performance, and tried to minimize the 
            amount of extra space used for each block by making efficient use 
            of bits. Code available upon request (which contains an in depth 
            explanation of how the allocator works).

        <h2>Project Lucid</h2>
        <p>
            As a part of the Game Creation Society (GCS) at Carnige Mellon, I 
            worked on a team to complete the game Lucid, a sidescrolling 2d 
            platformer/shooter written in Actionscript. I focused on 
            developing some of the physics, as well as level interpretation.

        <h2>Babble Generator</h2>
        <p>
            For my Parallel & Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms course 
            (15-210), I developed a program that generated text similar to 
            that of a specific person, given an input of a large body of text 
            from that person. Thus, given the works of Shakespeare, it can 
            generate sentences that sound like something that Shakespeare 
            would write. Code available on request.

        <h2>Mandelbrot Set Generator</h2>
        <p>
            As a challenge in my Principles of Functional Programming class, 
            I wrote a program for displaying something that would be 
            considered art. Since simply displaying a hard-coded piece of ascii 
            art is boring, I decided to make a fractal generator (specifically 
            the Mandelbrot Set). I made it in SML, and can be run by entering 
            "whatisart()" in the REPL (like with 
            <a href="http://www.smlnj.org/">SMLNJ</a>) after using the file. 
            The code can be found <a href="projects/mandelbrot.sml">here</a>.

        <p>
            In my free time I made a program for creating, editing, and 
            playing Picross puzzles (or more technically, 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">Nonograms</a>). 
            I created it because I enjoyed doing these puzzles and had 
            attempted to make a few, but I wanted an easier way to create, 
            store, and play them. This is just a condensed version of the 
            full thing, specifically made for playing a select few of some 
            of my better puzzles. To play, left-click to fill a square, 
            right-click to cross out a square, and click to clear a square.

        <h2>Monte Carlo Simulations in Bridge</h2>
        <p>
            During the summer of 2009 I worked with Professor Clyde Kruskal 
            at the University of Maryland to develop a program which runs 
            Monte Carlo Game Tree Search for a game of Bridge, and uses it 
            to experiment with the formula used in the search. You can read
